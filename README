    Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

    To Run this demo Workspace follow these simple instructions:

    1)  First open the file called "server.js" from the filetree on the left. 
          If you don't see the files panel, open it with Ctrl+U (cmd+U on Mac.)

    2)  With the file "server.js" as the active file press the Run button. 
          (The Run button is located in the middle of the Top menu bar.)

    3)  As soon as you hit Run the console will open showing you the link to the running server!
          Simply click the link and it will open in a new browser window!
        
        
        And that's all there's to it really! Just have fun and go ahead and edit 
        the code or add new files if you want. It's all up to you! 

        Happy coding!
        The Cloud9 IDE team

        P.S. Oh I almost forgot, to start a complete new project just hop on over to your 
        dashboard and hit the big green button labelled "Create New Workspace." :)
