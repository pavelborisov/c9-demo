    Hi there! Welcome to Cloud9 IDE!

    To get you started, we have created a few example applications.

    1) Select the technology that you want to use by selecting the folder

    2) Open the file underneath the folder

    3) Folow the run instructions in the comments
        
        And that's all there's to it really! Just have fun and go ahead and edit 
        the code or add new files if you want. It's all up to you! 

        Happy coding!
        The Cloud9 IDE team

        P.S. Oh I almost forgot, to start a complete new project just hop on over to your 
        dashboard and hit the big green button labelled "Create New Workspace." :)
